# Logging Guidelines

The listener uses [Winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston) for structured JSON logging. Every log entry follows a consistent schema to make logs machine-readable and easy to trace through the notification pipeline.

## Log Format

Each entry contains these standard fields:

| Field        | Type    | Description                                                    |
|--------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `timestamp`  | string  | ISO 8601 timestamp (added automatically)                       |
| `level`      | string  | Severity: `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`                     |
| `message`    | string  | Human-readable description of the event                        |
| `requestId`  | string  | Short UUID prefix scoped to a single poll cycle or API request |
| `correlationId` | string | UUID used to trace a single request across services (see below) |
| `durationMs` | number  | Elapsed milliseconds for timed operations                      |

Additional context fields (e.g. `contractAddress`, `eventId`) are appended as needed.

## Request IDs

A `requestId` is generated at the start of every poll cycle and every HTTP request. It is threaded through all log calls within that unit of work so you can trace a single notification from receipt to delivery.

## Correlation-ID middleware

Every HTTP request handled by the events API server (`listener/src/api/events-server.ts`) is passed through `applyRequestContext()` (`listener/src/utils/request-id.ts`) before any routing happens. It:

1. Mints a fresh `requestId` for the request (this is never reused across requests, unlike a correlation ID, which callers may deliberately pass through several hops).
2. Resolves a `correlationId` — reusing the caller's `X-Correlation-Id` request header when present, otherwise generating a new UUID. This lets a request be traced across services when the caller (a gateway, another internal service, or a retried client call) forwards its own correlation ID.
3. Echoes both back as `X-Request-Id` and `X-Correlation-Id` response headers.

```typescript
import { applyRequestContext } from '../utils/request-id';

const server = http.createServer(async (req, res) => {
  const { requestId, correlationId } = applyRequestContext(req, res);
  // ...pass requestId/correlationId into every logger call for this request
});
```

Every log call made while handling a request should include both `requestId` and `correlationId`.

```
2026-06-17T12:00:00.000Z info: Poll cycle complete {"requestId":"a1b2c3d4","durationMs":42}
2026-06-17T12:00:00.001Z info: Received events {"requestId":"a1b2c3d4","contractAddress":"CA...","count":2,"processed":2}
2026-06-17T12:00:00.002Z info: Processing event {"requestId":"a1b2c3d4","eventId":"event-1","eventName":"TaskCreated",...}
2026-06-17T12:00:00.005Z info: Sending Discord notification {"requestId":"a1b2c3d4","eventId":"event-1",...}
2026-06-17T12:00:00.120Z info: Discord notification delivered {"requestId":"a1b2c3d4","eventId":"event-1","durationMs":115}
2026-06-17T12:00:00.121Z info: Event processing complete {"requestId":"a1b2c3d4","eventId":"event-1","durationMs":119}
```

## Delivery Lifecycle Events

The following messages mark each stage of the notification pipeline:

| Stage                  | Level   | Message                                               |
|------------------------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Poll cycle start       | `info`  | `Poll cycle complete` (logged at end with duration)   |
| Events received        | `info`  | `Received events`                                     |
| Invalid payload        | `warn`  | `Skipping invalid event payload`                      |
| Event accepted         | `info`  | `Processing event`                                    |
| Discord send start     | `info`  | `Sending Discord notification`                        |
| Discord delivered      | `info`  | `Discord notification delivered`                      |
| Discord failed         | `error` | `Discord webhook failed`                              |
| Event done             | `info`  | `Event processing complete`                           |
| API request received   | `info`  | `Handling GET /api/events`                            |
| API request done       | `info`  | `GET /api/events complete`                            |
| Reconnect attempt      | `warn`  | `Attempting to reconnect`                             |
| Max retries exceeded   | `error` | `Max reconnection attempts exceeded, stopping service`|
| Scheduler batch start  | `info`  | `Processing batch of scheduled notifications`         |
| Scheduler batch done   | `info`  | `Scheduler batch complete`                            |
| Scheduled notification | `info`  | `Processing scheduled notification`                   |
| Registry at capacity   | `warn`  | `Event registry at capacity, evicting oldest events`  |

## Error Formatting

Errors passed in the `error` metadata field are automatically normalized into a structured object with `message`, `name`, `stack`, and optional `cause` fields. Use the exported `formatError()` helper when formatting errors outside the logger.

```typescript
import logger, { formatError } from '../utils/logger';

try {
  await deliverNotification();
} catch (error) {
  logger.error('Delivery failed', { requestId, error });
}
```

## Configuration

Set the `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable to control verbosity:

```
LOG_LEVEL=debug   # verbose, includes all messages
LOG_LEVEL=info    # default
LOG_LEVEL=warn    # warnings and errors only
LOG_LEVEL=error   # errors only
```

In development (`NODE_ENV` not set to `production`), logs use a colorized single-line format. In production they output newline-delimited JSON, suitable for ingestion by log aggregators such as Datadog, CloudWatch, or Loki.

## Adding New Log Calls

- Always pass `requestId` if one is available in the current scope.
- Use `durationMs` for any operation that involves I/O (RPC calls, webhook delivery, DB writes).
- Prefer structured metadata over embedding values in the message string.

```typescript
// good
logger.info('Processing event', { requestId, eventId, eventName, durationMs });

// avoid
logger.info(`Processing event ${eventId} (${eventName}) took ${durationMs}ms`);
```
